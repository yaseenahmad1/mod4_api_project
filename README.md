# TEAM A.S.K.'s [Ahmad, Smart, King]'s AirBnB Project
------------------------------------------------------
When in doubt... just A.S.K.!

# What we have accomplished :

1. Currently, we have implemented all of our models, migrations and seeders (minus the bookings).
2. We have also managed to get most of our endpoint routes down [spots-spotimages-reviews-reviewimages]
3. We are having issues with body validations for some endpoints and we have yet to complete the delete an image from a spot/delete an image from a review/search spots via query filters routes
4. The .destroy() method is proving to be a challenge for us in isolating a specific image. When we run our code, it for some strange reason deletes everything associated with that id.
5. What we have for now in our routes/api folder is successfully being tested in POSTMAN except for those pesky body validations which we assumed were going to be taken care of in our catch(error) towards the end of our routes.
